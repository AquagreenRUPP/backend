# Data Encryption Features

## Overview
The AquaGreen system now includes comprehensive data encryption to protect sensitive genetic data and files. All genetic data is automatically encrypted using industry-standard AES-256 encryption.

## Encryption Features Implemented

### 1. File Encryption
- **Algorithm**: AES-256 (Fernet encryption)
- **Scope**: All uploaded genetic data files (CSV/Excel)
- **Process**: Files are encrypted immediately upon upload
- **Storage**: Encrypted files are stored on disk, original content is never saved unencrypted

### 2. Database Encryption
- **Genetic Signatures**: Encrypted storage of genetic identifiers and breeding information
- **Metadata Encryption**: File metadata (original name, size, content type) is encrypted
- **Breeding Data**: Sensitive breeding information is encrypted before database storage

### 3. Key Management
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with SHA-256 (100,000 iterations)
- **Base Key**: Derived from Django SECRET_KEY
- **Salt**: Unique salt for genetic data encryption
- **Security**: Keys are never stored in plain text

### 4. Secure File Downloads
- **Decryption on Demand**: Files are decrypted only when downloaded by authorized users
- **Original Filename Preservation**: Encrypted metadata preserves original file information
- **Access Control**: Only file owners can download and decrypt their data

## Security Benefits

### Data Protection
- **At Rest**: All genetic data files are encrypted on disk
- **In Transit**: HTTPS encryption for all API communications
- **Access Control**: User-based access restrictions

### Compliance
- **Data Privacy**: Genetic information is protected against unauthorized access
- **Audit Trail**: Encryption timestamps and metadata tracking
- **Secure Deletion**: Complete cleanup of encrypted files and associated data

## User Interface Features

### Encryption Status Display
- **Dashboard**: Real-time encryption statistics on home page
- **File Cards**: Visual indicators showing encryption status
- **Progress Tracking**: Encryption percentage and file counts

### Secure Operations
- **Upload Notifications**: Users are informed about automatic encryption
- **Download Security**: Secure download buttons for encrypted files
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual feedback on encryption status

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components
1. **EncryptionManager** (`encryption_utils.py`)
   - Handles all encryption/decryption operations
   - Key derivation and management
   - JSON data encryption for complex structures

2. **Enhanced Models**
   - `GeneticData`: Added encryption flags and metadata fields
   - `GeneticRecord`: Added encrypted signature and breeding data fields

3. **Secure Views**
   - `SecureFileDownloadView`: Handles encrypted file downloads
   - `EncryptionStatusView`: Provides encryption statistics
   - Enhanced upload views with automatic encryption

### Frontend Components
1. **EncryptionStatus.vue**: Dashboard component showing encryption statistics
2. **Enhanced GeneticDataView.vue**: Shows encryption status and secure download options
3. **Security Notifications**: User-friendly encryption notices during upload

## API Endpoints

### New Encryption Endpoints
- `GET /file-uploader/genetic-data/<id>/download/` - Secure file download
- `GET /file-uploader/encryption/status/` - Encryption statistics

### Enhanced Existing Endpoints
- Upload endpoints now automatically encrypt files
- List endpoints include encryption status
- Detail endpoints show encryption metadata

## Database Schema Changes

### New Fields Added
```sql
-- GeneticData model
ALTER TABLE file_uploader_geneticdata ADD COLUMN is_encrypted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE file_uploader_geneticdata ADD COLUMN encrypted_metadata TEXT;

-- GeneticRecord model  
ALTER TABLE file_uploader_geneticrecord ADD COLUMN encrypted_genetic_signature TEXT;
ALTER TABLE file_uploader_geneticrecord ADD COLUMN encrypted_breeding_data TEXT;
```

## Usage Examples

### Uploading Encrypted Data
1. User uploads CSV/Excel file through the web interface
2. System automatically encrypts file content using AES-256
3. Encrypted file is saved to disk
4. Original metadata is encrypted and stored in database
5. Genetic records are created with encrypted sensitive data

### Downloading Encrypted Data
1. User clicks "Secure Download" button
2. System decrypts file content on-demand
3. Original filename and content type are restored
4. Decrypted file is served to user
5. No unencrypted data is stored temporarily

### Viewing Encryption Status
1. Dashboard shows real-time encryption statistics
2. File cards display encryption indicators
3. Detail views show encryption metadata
4. Progress bars indicate encryption coverage

## Security Considerations

### Best Practices Implemented
- **No Plain Text Storage**: Original files are never stored unencrypted
- **Secure Key Derivation**: Industry-standard PBKDF2 with high iteration count
- **Metadata Protection**: Even file metadata is encrypted
- **Access Control**: Only authenticated users can access their own data

### Future Enhancements
- **Key Rotation**: Implement periodic key rotation
- **Hardware Security**: Consider HSM integration for production
- **Audit Logging**: Enhanced logging of encryption operations
- **Backup Encryption**: Ensure backups maintain encryption

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Overhead
- **Upload**: Slight increase in processing time for encryption
- **Download**: On-demand decryption with minimal latency
- **Storage**: Encrypted files are similar in size to originals
- **Database**: Encrypted fields add minimal storage overhead

### Optimization
- **Streaming**: Large files are processed in chunks
- **Caching**: Encryption keys are cached for session duration
- **Async Processing**: File encryption doesn't block user interface

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Encryption status endpoint provides system health information
- Dashboard shows encryption coverage percentage
- Error handling for encryption/decryption failures

### Maintenance Tasks
- Regular verification of encrypted data integrity
- Monitoring of encryption performance metrics
- Backup verification with encryption validation

## Conclusion

The implemented encryption system provides comprehensive protection for genetic data while maintaining usability and performance. All sensitive information is automatically encrypted, and users have secure access to their data through intuitive interfaces.
